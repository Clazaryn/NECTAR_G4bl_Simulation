# NECTAR_G4bl_Simulation
The NECTAR G4 Beamline (G4bl) simulation is a 3-step simulation pipeline the simulates the NECTAR surrogate reaction experiments conducted at the Experimental Storage Ring at GSI, Darmstadt. This repository hosts the most generalised version of the simulation, but specialised analysis formats can and should be forked.
